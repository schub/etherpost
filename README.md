# etherpost.sh

Fetches an etherpad and writes it to an existing to wordpress post using the XML-RPC-API. 

So we can have multiple users editing an wordpress-post simultaniously and update it periodically.

## featuring

* UNIX shell
* curl
* python and it's xmlrpclib

## General

This is about to *edit* a post, not to *create* one. Create a posting and set its categories & tags in adavance and grab the post id. 

Currently, the title is defined in etherpost.sh and the script needs to be restarted in order to change it.

## Get started

Change variables in etherpost.sh to your needs:
* XML-RPC-API-URL
* username / password
* post id
* post title
* etherpad URL
* interval (default=60s)
* blog id (only relevant for wpmu installations)

Run etherpost.sh, preferable in a screen.

## What can be done 

Version for cronjob: Remove the while loop and the sleep-command in order to add script as a cronjob. 
Please commit a solution for logging when doing so :)

Parametrization of pyhton call: Currently while calling the python script the arguments need to be in correct order. One could add support for key/value-parameters, like --username=foo .

Or get rid of shell or python part: Cause my phyton skills are more limited than my shell skills, the python script handles the API-call but nothing else.

## About and license

etherpost.sh was created to enable a multiuser-live-blogging-mode for netzpolitik.org' coverage on the NSA investigation committee ("NSA-Untersuchungssausschuss") of the german parliament whose protocols will only be published with a huge delay -- if they will be published at all.

It is tinkered by wetterfrosch <wetter_Ã¤tt_netzpolitik_dott_org>, many thanks to Jan Sipke showing how to use python's xmlrpclib for interacting with wordpress:
